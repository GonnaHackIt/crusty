# Symphonia Check

A utility to test the output of a file decoded by Symphonia against `ffmpeg` and other reference decoders.

The currently supported reference decoders include:

* `ffmpeg`
* `flac`
* `mpg123` (when provided by `libmad` aka. `mpg321`)
* `oggdec`

## Prerequisites

The reference decoder must must be installed and present in your `PATH`.

## Usage

```bash
# Test a file, printing information on every packet with an error (no extra arguments).
symphonia-check /path/to/file

# Test a file, printing information on every sample with an error (--samples).
symphonia-check --samples /path/to/file

# Test a file, only printing the final test results (-q/--quiet).
symphonia-check -q /path/to/file

# Test a file, and abort the test on the first failed packet (-f/--first-fail).
symphonia-check -f /path/to/file

# Any of the above commands, without gapless playback enabled (--no-gapless).
symphonia-check --no-gapless /path/to/file

# Any of the above commands, using a specific reference decoder (--ref <decoder>).
symphonia-check --ref flac /path/to/flac/file
```

### Interpreting Results

Most files will pass, however, `symphonia-check` is a very simple tool, and a failure **does not** necessarily mean an invalid decoding. All decoders, including the reference decoders, contain bugs that can cause differences when tested against Symphonia.

Some scenarios can result in `symphonia-check` reporting large errors on almost all samples, yet when played sound okay. These scenarios are almost always false positives that can be caused by:

* The reference decoder or Symphonia dropping differing amounts of samples when encountering corruption.
* Testing a Symphonia decoder that does not support gapless playback without the `--no-gapless` flag.

In the first scenario, it is useful to verify the file decodes without any warnings from `ffmpeg`.

```bash
ffmpeg -v debug -i /path/to/file -f null -
```

Regardless, feel free to open an issue if you encounter a check failure. Please note that a sample file reproducing the failure is almost always required to triage the issue.
